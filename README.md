# Unveiling the GPA Champions: Analyzing Academic Performance Across AI and DS

🔍 **Me and Sami Ullah Abbasi** have been diving deep into the academic data of our university's seniors in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Using a custom-built web scraper with BeautifulSoup, we've meticulously gathered and analyzed GPA data. The most complicated work was to gather the Roll Numbers of all the batches which we extracted from PDF Files.

🖥️ **Our next step?** We've transformed this raw data into an insightful Power BI dashboard. 📊 It's not just about numbers; it's about uncovering trends and insights that can shape future academic strategies.

🏆 **Data Science Seniors Came out as the GPA Champions of 4th Semester beating Artificial Intelligence Seniors by a mere 0.08 GPA.**

👨‍💻 Proud to share this journey of data exploration and visualization. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to decode the story behind the numbers! 💡
